      Hi there! This is the one and only HTML file Vite serves during development.
      React mounts into the #root div below, and everything you see in the app
      is rendered by JavaScript.

      If youâ€™re looking for the app entry, check src/main.tsx.
      Global styles live in src/index.css. Have fun exploring!
    -->
    <div id="root"></div>
    <!-- Vite loads our React entry as an ES module. -->
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
